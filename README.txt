The assets and scripts are part of a larger project created by members of the
Video Game Development Club at UC Irvine.

CONTROLS:
*WASD - Move
*LeftClick - Draw sword(sword doesnt do anything in this scene)
*G key - Spin attack.

The player will take damage if the enemy touches him/her.
The scene will reset once the player dies.
